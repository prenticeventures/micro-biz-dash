2. Click the **"+"** button (top left, next to "My Apps")

You'll see a form. Fill it out like this:

### Required Fields:

**Platform:**

**Name:**
- Enter: **Micro-Biz Dash**

**Primary Language:**
- Select **English (U.S.)** or your preferred English variant

**Bundle ID:**
- Click the dropdown
- Select: **com.microbizdash.app**
- (This should already be there since we configured it!)

**SKU:**
- Enter: **micro-biz-dash-001**
- (This is just a unique identifier - can be anything, won't be visible to users)

## ✅ Step 4: Create the App

1. Review all the information
2. Click **"Create"** button
3. Wait a moment - App Store Connect will create your app listing

## 🎯 Step 5: Initial App Information

After creation, you'll be taken to your app's page. You'll see several tabs:

**1. App Information** (we'll fill this out)
**2. Pricing and Availability**
**3. Version Information**
**4. App Store** (screenshots, description, etc.)

Let's start with **App Information**:

### App Information Tab:

**Subtitle:** (Optional - 30 characters max)
- Example: "Survive the 2026 economy!"
- Or leave blank for now

**Category:**
- **Primary Category:** Select **Games** → **Action**
- **Secondary Category:** (Optional) Select **Games** → **Arcade**

**Content Rights:**
- Check the box: "I confirm that I have the rights to use all content in this app"

**Age Rating:**
- Click **"Edit"** next to Age Rating
- Complete the questionnaire (for a game like yours, likely will be **4+** or **9+**)
- Answer honestly - it's usually quick
- Click **"Save"**

---

## 💰 Step 6: Pricing and Availability

Click the **"Pricing and Availability"** tab:

**Price:**
- Select **Free** (or set a price if you want to charge)

**Availability:**
- Select all countries (default) or specific ones
- Usually leave as "All countries"

**Click "Save"** at the top right

---

## 📸 What's Next?

After you complete these steps, we'll need to:

1. **Create screenshots** (I can help with this!)
2. **Write app description** (I can draft this!)
3. **Add keywords** (I can suggest these!)
4. **Build and upload** the app

## 🐛 Common Issues

**"Bundle ID not found"**
- Make sure you're using: `com.microbizdash.app`
- If it's not in the dropdown, you may need to create it first in the Developer Portal

**"Name already taken"**
- Try: "Micro-Biz Dash 2026" or add your name/company

**Can't find "New App" button**
- Make sure you're in "My Apps" section
- Check that your Apple Developer account is active
