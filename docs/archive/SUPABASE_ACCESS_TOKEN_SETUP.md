# Give Me Supabase Access (Automated Setup)

If you provide me with a Supabase **Personal Access Token**, I can do almost all the setup work automatically! This will save you from clicking around in menus.

## How to Get Your Supabase Access Token

1. **Go to Supabase Account Settings:**
   - Visit: https://app.supabase.com/account/tokens
   - Or: Click your profile icon (top right) → **Account** → **Access Tokens** tab

2. **Create a New Token:**
   - Click **"Generate New Token"** or **"Create Token"**
   - Give it a name like: `Micro-Biz Dash Setup`
   - Set expiration (optional - you can set it to expire in 30 days, or leave it permanent)
   - Click **"Generate Token"**

3. **Copy the Token:**
   - ⚠️ **Important:** Copy it immediately! You won't be able to see it again.
   - It will look like: `sbp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

4. **Share It With Me:**
   - Just paste the token in a message to me
   - I'll use it to set up everything automatically

## What I'll Be Able to Do With This Token

✅ **Create database tables** (run the SQL schema automatically)  
✅ **Set up Row Level Security policies**  
✅ **Verify everything is working**  
✅ **Test the connection**  
✅ **Set up your `.env.local` file** (if you want)

## Security Notes

- This token gives me access to manage your Supabase project
- You can **revoke it anytime** from the same page
- I can only access the project(s) you give me access to
- Once setup is complete, you can revoke the token if you want

## Alternative: Just Share Project Info

If you prefer not to share a token, you can just:
1. Tell me your **Project URL** (from the browser address bar)
2. Tell me your **Project ID** (the long id in the URL)
3. I'll guide you through the rest, but it will require more manual steps

---

**Recommendation:** Share the access token - it'll let me do 90% of the work for you! 🚀
