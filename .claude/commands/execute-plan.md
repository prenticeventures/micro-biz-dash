# Execute Plan

Execute a previously created plan step by step.

## Usage

When asked to execute a plan:
1. Work through each step systematically
2. Create or modify files as needed
3. Test each major change
4. Report progress and any issues encountered
5. Ask for confirmation before major changes

## Approach

- One step at a time
- Test frequently
- Explain what I'm doing in simple terms
- Fix issues as they arise
