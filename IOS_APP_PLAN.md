# iOS App Store Conversion Plan
## Micro-Biz Dash: From Web to Native iOS App

---

## 📋 Overview

**Goal:** Convert your React web game into a native iOS app and publish it on the App Store.

**Approach:** Use **Capacitor** (by Ionic) to wrap your existing web app. This allows you to:
- Keep 95% of your existing code
- Add native iOS features easily
- Deploy to both iOS and Android later (if desired)
- Maintain one codebase

---

## 🎯 Prerequisites Checklist

Before we start, you'll need:

### Required:

- [ ] **Node.js** (you already have this ✓)

### Recommended:
- [ ] Physical iPhone/iPad for testing (simulator works but device is better)
